# Schottenfreude Flashcards

## What?
A test-your-self flashcard app using words from Schottenfreude by Ben Schott. Currently just a flip-check and not a quiz that looks at your answers and lets you know the obvious. It relies on your head and not JS to determine if you're right. (JS possibly in the future)

## Why?
To play with flashcards in TailwindCSS and to have a reference later.

## What if ...?
Currently it's just a playground, but ... 
What if we made it more interactive and quizzy?
What if we allowed the user to choose short, medium, or long words (or keep it a mix)?

## How?
Vite, React, Tailwind

Vite mumbo jumbo
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
